\section{My Interests in Economics \& Data Science}

I decided to take this class because I am currently a PhD student, and my research frequently involves working with various types of data. I want to equip myself with all the powerful tools available in data science to enhance my research capabilities. In this AI era, I also aim to strengthen my advantage in using AI for coding and data analysis. For my class project, I plan to work with accounting archival data, which aligns with my research interests. My goals for this class are to master more methodological approaches and develop stronger computational skills that will benefit my research. After graduation, I aspire to pursue an academic career at a university.
